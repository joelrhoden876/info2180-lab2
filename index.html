<h2>Interest in Aviation</h2>

<p> My interest in aviation sparked from a very tender age. I can remember even back to before I went on an aircraft for the first time I've always said I wanted to become a pilot. This was mainly due to me being around my Godfather who is a pilot for the Jamaica Defence Force. He was somewhat of a role model to me and someone I look up to even to this day. Though I don't want the exact career as him as I'm more interested in commercial aviation, I still believe my interest in aviation is due to his influence and involvement in my childhood years.</p>
<p> A question I tend to get asked a lot is why am I studying computer science if aviation is my aspired field of work. Well, Computer Science was my plan b in case there was any hindrance between me and my aviation dreams. In this case it was the high cost of study in the field and the lack of opportunities associated with the field in Jamaica. However, after completing my degree I hope to branch off into the aviation industry if it's God's will.</p>

<h2>Experience at UWI</h2>

<p>Over the past year, being enrolled in the University of the West Indies has been somewhat of a life changing experience especially since boarding on campus. As I'm from a small rural community, being here has allowed me to meet many new people, learn new things, and really opened my eyes to the cultural diversity which Jamaica possesses. Though my classes were online for the entire fist year and I basically missed the whole first year experience, I still got a chance to experience what life was like on campus or as a university student on a whole. </p>
<p>I must add that it hasn't always been easy. My first year had it's fair share of ups and downs but I believe if I made it through first year I will be able to make it through the remainder of my program length. As we slowly transition to the regular face to face modality of classes and other activities, I hope to see positive results reflecting in my academic performance as online classes were a bit of a struggle due to various reasons. That being said, I am looking forward to what my remaining years at UWI have in store.</p>
